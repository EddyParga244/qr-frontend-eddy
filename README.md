- Github deploy: (https://eddyparga244.github.io/qr-frontend-eddy/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Previously, I attended a complete course of HTML and CSS, and I used this challenge to put to practice what I learned.
I managed to make a design as close as I could to the preview image, but I think the responsive aspect of it could use some refinement.

### Continued development

On the next challenge I think I'll use either Flexbox or Grid methods to make better responsive web pages.
